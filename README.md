<h3>Activities Undertaken:</h3>
<p>Throughout the project, I spearheaded various critical tasks, including:</p>

- Tread Design
- Conducting Manufacturing Feasibility Studies
- Calculating Product Costs
- Evaluating Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Results
- Performing Risk Analysis (DFMEA)
- Engaging in Theoretical Calculations and Layout Designs
- Overseeing Prototype Manufacturing and Testing
- Managing ISO Documentation
- Facilitating Industrialization Processes
- Updating Master Data in SAP

<h3>Tools Utilized:</h3>

- PLM (Product Lifecycle Management): Windchill
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning): SAP
- Design Software: SolidWorks
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA): Abaqus
  
<p>Throughout the MPT-793S project, a suite of advanced software tools was employed to streamline various aspects of the development process. Windchill served as the cornerstone for managing the product lifecycle, ensuring efficient collaboration, version control, and documentation management. SAP facilitated seamless integration across manufacturing processes, resource planning, and data management. SolidWorks, a robust CAD software, was instrumental in conceptualizing and refining the tire design, providing comprehensive modeling and simulation capabilities. Abaqus, a powerful FEA tool, enabled in-depth analysis of structural integrity, performance optimization, and validation, ensuring the tire's reliability under diverse operating conditions.</p>

<h3>Achievement:</h3>
 Successful Customer Sample Shipment and On-Time Commencement of Mass Production

As a testament to our dedication and meticulous planning, the MPT-793S project achieved a major milestone with the successful shipment of customer samples. Not only did we meet this critical milestone, but we also commenced mass production according to the predetermined schedule. This accomplishment underscores our team's proficiency in project management, technical expertise, and commitment to delivering exceptional results.
